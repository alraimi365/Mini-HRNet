### **Instructions**

This folder should contain the dataset files required for training and evaluating the model. Our model uses the **Cityscapes dataset** for semantic segmentation.

#### **Folder Structure**
After downloading and extracting the dataset, the directory should be structured as follows:

```
data/
â”‚-- gtFine/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ train/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ val/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ test/
â”‚-- leftImg8bit/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ train/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ val/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ test/
```
